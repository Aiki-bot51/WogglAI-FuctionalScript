# WogglAI-FuctionalScript
Jez Whitworth Create an AI chatbot called "Woggle" but as the years have gone by the scripts have become out dated and don't function anymore, we have fixed that but unforunetly the question system that allows woggle to go to the internet and bring back information no longer works but you still get the AI.

# Step 0 - Preperation
Make sure you have a raspberry pi with an sd card in it running resbian (It's fine to be running resbian on noobs)
Then check to make sure your version of resbian, python 3, and wolfram are up to date

# Step 1
Download the program files from Github (These withh replce the files Jez Whitworth have provided)

# Step 2
Watch this video which will explain how to create a Wolframalpha account and how to get your appid

# Step 3
Open the "Chat" script in a text editor by right clicking it and the go to "open with" (DO NOT OPEN IN PYTHON YET)

# Step 4
In the chat script go to line 55 and where it says 'here' paste your code so it looks like this: 'Your appid here'

# Step 5 
Put the Chat script along with any SQ files onto an external storage device that you can put into your rasberry pi

# Step 6
Once your raspberry pi is booted open the start menu and open python 3 (IDLE), In the top left press file, then open and find the directory of the Chat file. You will see another window woth the script open up, got to the top and press run, then Run Module.

# Step 7 - Enjoy
